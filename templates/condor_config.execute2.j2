##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor. This is where
##  you define where the local config file is. Any settings
##  made here may potentially be overridden in the local configuration
##  file.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!  To double-check that a variable is
##  getting set from the configuration file that you expect, use
##  condor_config_val -v <variable name>
##
##  condor_config.annotated is a more detailed sample config file
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.

##  Where have you installed the bin, sbin and lib condor directories?

##  Where is the local condor directory for each host?  This is where the local config file(s), logs and

REQUIRE_LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = false

##  The normal way to do configuration with RPM and Debian packaging is to read all of the
##  files in a given directory that don't match a regex as configuration files.
##  Config files are read in lexicographic order.
##  Multiple directories may be specified, separated by commas; directories
##  are read in left-to-right order.

##
## Do NOT use host-based security by default.
##
## This was the default for the 8.8 series (and earlier), but it is
## intrinsically insecure.  To make the 9.0 series secure by default, we
## commented it out.
##
## You should seriously consider improving your security configuration.
##
## To continue to use your old security configuration, knowing that it is
## insecure, add the line 'use SECURITY:HOST_BASED' to your local
## configuration directory.  Don't just uncomment the final line in this
## comment block; changes in this file may be lost during your next upgrade.
## The following shell command will make the change on most Linux systems.
##
## echo 'use SECURITY:HOST_BASED' >> $(condor_config_val LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR)/00-insecure.config
